An iPhone interface into http://bbc.co.uk/programmes
----------------------------------------------------

This was an experiment in building an native iphone webapp using just
Dashcode as the IDE. You can drill down from tv and radio services and
view day schedules. Feel free to borrow and extend, as long as you give
me a little mention, thanks.
